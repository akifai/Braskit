# Braskit

Lightweight imageboard script written in PHP with a PostgreSQL backend.

**Do not use this software. It is still in early beta and is not yet ready for
production use. Contributors are welcome.**

## Requirements

* Some webserver
* PHP >= 5.3
* PostgreSQL >= 9.2
* GD (library) or Imagemagick (CLI/library)

MySQL will not work. Period. Don't even try.

## Project goal

Create a scalable, extendable and easily configurable imageboard script which is
capable of powering multiple high-traffic imageboard sites on a single server.
